Click any of the above buttons to download an import file for a *new* modded Minecraft instance. The Generic button is for the Prism launcher.

Doing this is like re-installing from scratch - all your keybinds, JourneyMap waypoints and exploration data, EVERYTHING will be set back to "factory defaults".

If you find this is unappealing, see the Discord update on how to patch your game instead.
