Click any of the above buttons to download an import file for a *new* modded Minecraft instance.

Doing this is like re-installing from scratch - all your keybinds, JourneyMap waypoints and exploration data, EVERYTHING will be set back to "factory defaults".

If you find this is unappealing, see the Discord update on how to patch your game instead.

v1.0.5

Added mod: Pipez
-Cheaper, easier way to move items and fluids around. More importantly, these pipes can filter by NBT data, which is critically important for sorting large quantities of Apothic Affix drops. Yes, I added this because of the Ender Ender.

Added mod: Torchmaster
-Tom wouldn't stop complaining about Blizz mobs around his house.

Added mod: Polymorph
-In case multiple mods add identical crafting recipes with different outputs, this mod lets you choose which one to use.

Added mod: Extreme sound muffler
-You can selectively silence any sound using this mod.

Added mod: Construction Wand
-Builder's wands are nice QoL tools that let you place large swathes of identical blocks in a pattern.

Added mod: Create Enchantment Industry
-Automated enchanting, disenchantment, and book duplication using XP.

Added mod: Tom's Simple Storage
-You win, whiners.

Added mod: Create Big Cannons
-Tom takes full responsibility here. This mod can level entire buildings. Please be responsible.


Added Curios Goggles Slot
-Tom complained that he couldn't have a Curios hat and his Create goggles. So I added a slot *just* for his goggles.

Added Curios Backpack Slot
-Tom complained that he couldn't have a Curios back slot item and a backpack. So I added a slot *just* for backpacks.

These Curios slots requires use of a client-side resource pack. If you are patching your game, make sure to follow the steps completely.
